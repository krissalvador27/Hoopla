Hoopla
================

Written by interns Kris Salvador, Carter Wheatley, Emilio Mendoza, Jonathan Reyes and Justin Shiiba
during Wayfair's 2014 Hackathon!

Hoopla was a web based forum similar in style to reddit that categorized forums by domain of user email.
The idea is that users with @<insert-college-here>.edu emails or @<insert-company-here>.com would have their own Hoopla forum to easily communicate with others in their university or company community. A combination reddit and craigslist, the community driven forums could drive trades, sales, gatherings etc.

Further features worth noting:
 - Tagging users via @user_name would notify via email what Hoop (post) they were tagged in
 - Up voting functionality of posts
 - Functional log in and email authentication system

Future Improvements/To dos:
 - Allow use of images (and possibly gifs) within la's (comments) and Hoops
